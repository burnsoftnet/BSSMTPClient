# BSSMTPClient
The BurnSoft SMTP Client was created as a command line base email client that will allow you to send emails with or without attachments for automation purposes.  We mostly use this function in our scripts and some programs to email us when there is an alert or an issue with a log file and email us the log file.

<b>NOTE:  The Use Proxy functions have still not be implemented and is the current work in progress!</b>
